      </p>

        Please read these Terms of Service carefully before you start to use our Platform.  By using the Platform (or by clicking to accept or agree to the Terms of Service when this option is made available to you), you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms of Service,<a href="https://www.quadio.com/community-guidelines"> our community guidelines</a> (the "Community Guidelines") and our <u>privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy")</u>, which is incorporated herein by reference.

By using our Platform, you represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract with Quadio and meet all of the foregoing eligibility requirements.  If you do not meet all of these requirements, you must not access or use the Platform.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Quadio Accounts
      </h3>

      <p>
        To use the Platform, you must register, or have previously registered, a Quadio account (an "Account").  Accounts are currently restricted to students enrolled at select U.S. colleges, as determined by Quadio, and as may be amended from time to time.  In order to create an Account, you must (1) be a college student actively enrolled in (or an alumnus of) at least one course at a college geographically located in one of the 50 United States and preapproved by Quadio, (2) be able to provide proof of enrollment (or graduation) upon request and (3) have a valid e-mail address that contains the domain suffix .edu.  We may accept or refuse Account registration in our sole discretion.  We may ask you to furnish documentation supporting your eligibility.  If you do not provide documentation indicating that you meet the eligibility requirements above, we may terminate your Account.  You may not transfer or assign your Account.  You may not use your student e-mail address for more than one Account.  You may not register for a new Account more than once.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are two main types of Quadio Accounts - listener and artist.  Listener Accounts are the default Account type.  When you attempt to upload music to the Platform for the first time, you will be prompted to enter additional Account profile details in order to upgrade your Account type to an artist Account.  If you setup an artist profile, you can then upload music to the Platform and create or join bands.  You may also setup an artist profile manually if you want to join a band on Quadio without uploading music tracks.
      </p>

      <p>
        You are only entitled to create one Account on the Platform.  The Platform will allow you to toggle between your artist profile and one or more band profiles for the purpose of "operating as" your profile of choice on the Platform.  The original creator of a band will be the default administrator of the band profile, will full access and control of the band profile.  The band creator may invite other users of the Platform to be band members, if they have artist Account profiles configured.  Band members may have a limited set of access privileges, as determined by the band creator and permitted by the Platform.
      </p>

      <p>
        Creation and use of Accounts are subject to the following terms and conditions:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          When you create or update an Account, you must provide Quadio with accurate and up-to-date information that is personal to you, including, but not limited to, your name and school email address.  Additionally, in order to create an artist Account or use certain features offered on the Platform, you will also be required to provide Quadio with additional profile information. Quadio shall also have the right to obtain non-personal data related to your connection to the Platform.
        </li><br>

        <li>
          Your Account username will be your school email address. You must select a unique password for your Account. You may not use your real name as the password for the Account, and you cannot share your Account credentials with anyone, unless these Terms of Service allow it.
        </li><br>

        <li>
          You must maintain the confidentiality of your password, as you are responsible for all uses of your Account, including any purchases, whether or not authorized by you. If you become aware of or reasonably suspect any breach of security, including without limitation any loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure of your Account password, you must immediately notify Quadio at help@quadio.com.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You agree to pay all fees and applicable taxes incurred by you or anyone using your Account. If you choose a recurring subscription for any Quadio products or services, you acknowledge that payments may be processed automatically (e.g., charged to your credit card) until you cancel your subscription or your Account.  Quadio may revise the pricing for the goods and services offered through the Platform at any time. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT QUADIO IS NOT REQUIRED TO REFUND AMOUNTS YOU PAY TO QUADIO FOR USE OF THE PLATFORM, OR FOR PURCHASES MADE THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT ON THE PLATFORM, FOR ANY REASON.

        Rights to User Content
      </h3>

      <p>
        As an Account holder you may submit User Content to the Platform, including sound recordings, pictures, videos, text, messages, information, playlist information, comments and/or other types of content. You understand that Quadio does not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to any User Content you submit.
      </p>

      <p>
        You shall be solely responsible for your own User Content and the consequences of submitting and publishing your User Content on the Platform. You affirm, represent, and warrant that you own or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to publish User Content you submit; and you license to Quadio all patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary rights in and to such User Content for publication on the Platform pursuant to these Terms of Service.
      </p>

      <p>
        For clarity, you retain all of your ownership rights in your User Content. <u>Further, Quadio will not share your User Content with third parties outside of the Platform without first obtaining your explicit consent to do so.</u> However, by submitting User Content to Quadio,<u> Quadio requires the following license from you in order to operate the Platform and perform the services requested.</u>
      </p>

      <p>
        You hereby grant Quadio a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicenseable and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the User Content in connection with the <u>operation of the</u> Platform and Quadio's (and its successors' and affiliates') business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Platform (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels.  You also hereby grant each user of the Platform a non-exclusive license to access your User Content through the Platform <u>for non-commercial purposes</u>, and to use, reproduce, distribute, display and perform such User Content as permitted through the functionality of the Platform and under these Terms of Service.  The above licenses granted by you in sound recording User Content you submit to the Platform terminate within a commercially reasonable time after you remove or delete your sound recordings from the Platform.  You understand and agree, however, that Quadio may retain, but not display, distribute, or perform, server copies of your sound recordings that have been removed or deleted. The above licences granted by you in user comments you submit are prepetual and irrevocable.
      </p>

      <p>
        You further agree that User Content you submit to the Platform will not contain third party copyrighted material, or material that is subject to other third party proprietary rights, unless you have permission from the rightful owner of the material or you are otherwise legally entitled to post the material and to grant Quadio all of the license rights granted herein. Where applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive any "moral rights" (or the equivalent under applicable law), such as your right to be identified as the author of any User Content, and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content. If such moral rights are not waivable, then you at least agree not to sue us for failure to identify you as the author of any User Content or for any use of your User Content on the Platform.
      </p>

      <p>
        Quadio does not endorse any User Content submitted to the Platform by any user or other licensor, or any opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed therein, and Quadio expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with User Content. Quadio does not permit copyright infringing activities and infringement of intellectual property rights on the Platform, and Quadio will remove all Content if properly notified that such Content infringes on another's intellectual property rights.  Quadio reserves the right to remove User Content without prior notice.
      </p>

      <p>
        You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on the Platform, (i) such User Content, or its use by Quadio as contemplated by these Terms of Service, does not violate the publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Quadio or any other artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from such individual or entity, and (ii) no royalties or other fees will be payable by Quadio to any third party for the reproduction, distribution, public display, public performance, creation of derivative works, or other use or exploitation of such User Content.
      </p>

      <p>
        Quadio may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content. Because there is a risk to hosting user uploaded content, including User Content, Quadio reserves the right, in all cases, to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including, but not limited to, User Content that, in Quadio's sole discretion, violates these Terms of Service, the rights of any third party, poses a reputational risk to Quadio or any other person, or would cause Quadio to be in breach of any agreement to which Quadio is a party. Quadio may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party and without any liability to you for such removal. However, Quadio does not obligate itself to remove any User Content except as required by law.
      </p>

      <p>
        You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post, so please be careful about what you post. Don't defame people on the Platform. As you would expect, Quadio is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content. YOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST QUADIO RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD QUADIO HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM AND/OR YOUR BREACH OF THE REPRESENTATIONS SET FORTH IN THESE TERMS OF SERVICE.

The arbitration shall be held before a single arbitrator agreed upon by the parties or, in the event the parties do not agree, appointed by the applicable arbitral body. All AAA arbitration proceedings shall be held in Brooklyn, New York, unless otherwise agreed by the parties and arbitrator.
